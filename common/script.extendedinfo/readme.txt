The old addon from scott967 does not seem to be maintained anymore.
A new fork from fryhenryj is still updated.

The repository dependency was removed, otherwise Kodi throws an error about the dependency, even though it is marked as optional.

		<import addon="repository.jurialmunkey" version="2.2" optional="true" />
